<h1>A Dreamer's Journey</h1>

<p>
I chase the sun,with weary eyes <br>
A heart that yearns,for a life that rises <br>
Above the grind, of daily strife <br>
To join an NGO, and make a difference in life
</p>
<p>
By day, I toil, in a bank's cold space<br>
Numbers and screens, a soulless pace<br>
But night's quiet hours, I steal away<br>
To study, to dream,  of a better day.
</p>
<p>
An Msc in Business, a step to my goal<br>
To empower communities, make hearts whole<br>
But doubts creep in, like shadows on the wall<br>
"Am I enough?" "Will I crumble, will I fall?"<br>
</p>
<p>
Still I push on, through exhaustion's haze<br>
For every step forward, brings a better gaze<br>
On the world needs, on the heart that ache<br>
My passion beats strong, my spirit doesn't break. <br>
</p>
<p>
Impact flawed, but my own <br>
This journey's mine, with trials unknown<br>
I'll stumble, rise, and stumble again<br>
For in the NGO's entrance, my heart finds its home.<br>
